 * black square in the corner of the page. `useComputedColorScheme` resolves
 * "auto" to whichever the user is actually seeing, which is the thing that has
 * to match.
 *
 * Rounded and clipped here rather than in the files: the square edge is what
 * makes a raster logo look pasted on, and the radius has to follow the size it
 * is rendered at.
